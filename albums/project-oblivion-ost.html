        an official soundtrack album for a mindustry mod by <strong>uujuju1</strong> called <b>"Project Oblivion"</b>. 
        this album contains 12 original tracks but only 9 tracks are used in the game. there are 3 soundtracks that didn't 
        get to the game: <b>"The new world"</b>, <b>"Before the apocalypse"</b>, and <b>"Son of a robot".</b>
            <br><br>the <a href="https://youtu.be/aJP3ACztzb8">first track</a> for the mod was released on April 11th, 2022, 
            but actually it's just a concept/experimental soundtrack. and after the release of the first soundtrack, 
            i released some more concept/experimental soundtracks (and did some collaboration 
            with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt8LDAfecEAsDN4FmJ_XwPQ">DJ Silin</a>).
            <br><br>in the first version(s) of <b>Project Oblivion</b>, all the concept/experimental soundtracks
            were added to the game, but a few versions/updates later all the soundtracks were removed because 
            they didn't fit the mod's theme.<br><br>
            the first <b>non-concept/non-experimental</b> <a href="https://youtu.be/Jm8Nz2HR-FI">soundtrack</a> was released 
            on <b>May 24th, 2022</b>. 
            that soundtrack (along with other new soundtracks) are then added to a separate repository 
            (<a href="https://github.com/uujuju1/poost">here</a>). the soundtracks are intentionally separated from 
            the mod so that the mod size doesn't get too big.
