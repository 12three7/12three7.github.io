        <h1 id="projectoblivionost">Project Oblivion OST</h1>

        <p>an official soundtrack album for a mindustry mod by <strong>uujuju1</strong> called <strong>"Project Oblivion"</strong>. this album contains 12 original tracks but only 9 tracks are used in the game. there are 3 soundtracks that didn't get to the game: <strong>"The new world"</strong>, <strong>"Before the apocalypse"</strong>, and <strong>"Son of a robot".</strong>  </p>

        <p>the <a href="https://youtu.be/aJP3ACztzb8">first track</a> for the mod was released on April 11th, 2022, but actually it's just a concept/experimental soundtrack. and after the release of the first soundtrack, i released some more concept/experimental soundtracks (and did some collaboration with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt8LDAfecEAsDN4FmJ_XwPQ">DJ Silin</a>).  </p>

        <p>in the first version(s) of <strong>Project Oblivion</strong>, all the concept/experimental soundtracks were added to the game, but a few versions/updates later all the soundtracks were removed because they didn't fit the mod's theme.  </p>

        <p>the first <strong>non-concept/non-experimental</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/Jm8Nz2HR-FI">soundtrack</a> was released on <strong>May 24th, 2022</strong>. that soundtrack (along with other new soundtracks) are then added to a separate repository (<a href="https://github.com/uujuju1/poost">here</a>). the soundtracks are intentionally separated from the mod so that the mod size doesn't get too big.</p>
