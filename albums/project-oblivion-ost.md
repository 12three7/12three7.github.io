# Project Oblivion OST

an official soundtrack album for a mindustry mod by **uujuju1** called **"Project Oblivion"**. this album contains 12 original tracks but only 9 tracks are used in the game. there are 3 soundtracks that didn't get to the game: **"The new world"**, **"Before the apocalypse"**, and **"Son of a robot".**  

the [first track](https://youtu.be/aJP3ACztzb8) for the mod was released on April 11th, 2022, but actually it's just a concept/experimental soundtrack. and after the release of the first soundtrack, i released some more concept/experimental soundtracks (and did some collaboration with [DJ Silin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt8LDAfecEAsDN4FmJ_XwPQ)).  

in the first version(s) of **Project Oblivion**, all the concept/experimental soundtracks were added to the game, but a few versions/updates later all the soundtracks were removed because they didn't fit the mod's theme.  

the first **non-concept/non-experimental** [soundtrack](https://youtu.be/Jm8Nz2HR-FI) was released on **May 24th, 2022**. that soundtrack (along with other new soundtracks) are then added to a separate repository ([here](https://github.com/uujuju1/poost)). the soundtracks are intentionally separated from the mod so that the mod size doesn't get too big.
