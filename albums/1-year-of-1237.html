        <p>my first anniversary album & my biggest album in 2021. this album was released on <b>September 12th, 2021</b>, exactly 1 year after the release of <b>"0"</b>, my first release <i>(which was released on September 12th 2020)</i>. this album contains 30 new, original track recorded between June 2021 and September 2021. <i>(and yes it's not a compilation album)</i>.<br><br>
        all the track titles in this album represents the duration of the track. <code>' = minutes</code> and <code>" = seconds</code>. the first track is titled <b>4'07"</b> because its duration is <b>4 minutes and 7 seconds</b>, the second track is titled <b>3'23"</b> because its duration is <b>3 minutes and 23 seconds</b>, and so on <i>(i should stop naming my songs using this format)</i>.
        </p>
        <p>this album has 4 sides,
           each side contains 7 to 8 tracks
           <i>and those sides were just added 
           a few hours before i wrote this paragraph</i>.<br><br>
           the music style of side a & b tracks are pretty similar to tracks from <b>12:4:8</b> and <b>Dimensi 7</b>. except for the last 3 tracks in the B side.
