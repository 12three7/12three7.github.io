        <p>my first anniversary album & my biggest album in 2021. this album was released on <b>September 12th, 2021</b>, exactly 1 year after the release of <b>"0"</b>, my first release <i>(which was released on September 12th 2020)</i>. this album contains 30 new, original track recorded between June 2021 and September 2021. <i>(and yes it's not a compilation album)</i>.<br><br>
        all the track titles in this album represents the duration of the track. <code>' = minutes</code> and <code>" = seconds</code>. the first track is titled <b>4'07"</b> because its duration is <b>4 minutes and 7 seconds</b>, the second track is titled <b>3'23"</b> because its duration is <b>3 minutes and 23 seconds</b>, and so on <i>(i should stop naming my songs using this format)</i>.
        </p>
        <p>this album has 4 sides,
           each side contains 7 to 8 tracks<i>and those sides were just added a few hours before i wrote this paragraph</i>.<br><br>
           (most of) the music style of a & b side tracks are pretty similar to tracks from <b>12:4:8</b> and <b>Dimensi 7</b>. but the last 3 tracks from side b are chiptune tracks -- i haven't made any chiptune music for a long while, so (when i made this album) i decided to make chiptunes again and then i put those chiptune tracks in the album.
           <br><br>c side is the side that has the most chiptune tracks. yeah, i really like chiptunes, but there are (still) some non-chiptune tracks (those tracks were made when i got tired of making chiptunes).
           <br><br>most of the tracks from the d side are tracks from a failed/discontinued album. the album was planned to release the on August/September 2021, but then i decided to move some of the tracks from that album to <b>1 year of 1237</b>. there are 9 tracks on the failed album, but only 6 tracks were ""moved"" to <b>1 year of 1237</b>. i accidentally deleted the other 3 tracks. why did i move all the tracks from the failed album to <b>1 year of 1237</b>? <i>i don't know</i>
